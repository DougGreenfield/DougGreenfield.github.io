This is a map of objects that are dropped on New Year's Eve
I made it based on a page from Wikipedia - 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_objects_dropped_on_New_Year%27s_Eve
There is a static map (nye.jpeg) and an interactive version (newyre.html)

The static map was made mostly using QGIS, the interactive map is via Leaflet using
a basemap from CARTO.

Some of the items listed on that page were either one time events of have been discontinued,
these were not included on the map.
